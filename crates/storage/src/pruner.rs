//! Deleting block history the node no longer needs.
//!
//! Distinct from the trie collector in `epoch_store`, which reclaims *state*.
//! This reclaims *chain data*: headers, bodies, receipts (and therefore the
//! events in them), the transaction index, and the canonical mapping, for
//! blocks far enough behind the head that nothing can ask for them.
//!
//! # How deep is far enough
//!
//! Two independent requirements stack:
//!
//! - **Reorg tolerance.** The node must be able to rebuild from a
//!   reorganisation up to `D` blocks deep, which needs the blocks themselves.
//! - **Block-info precompiles, and REMASC.** Rootstock exposes precompiles that
//!   read attributes of recent blocks, reaching up to 4,000 blocks back, and
//!   REMASC pays out with a maturity of 4,000. Executing a block at height `h`
//!   may therefore read data from `h - 4000`.
//!
//! They compose rather than overlap: after a 4,000-block reorg the node
//! re-executes from `head - 4000`, and executing *that* block may reach back a
//! further 4,000. So the shallowest safe retention is **8,000 blocks**, and
//! [`MIN_KEEP_DEPTH`] is a floor the configuration cannot go below.
//!
//! # Gaps are a supported state
//!
//! After pruning, the database has no blocks below a floor. Everything that
//! walks the chain must tolerate that: `ensure_canonical_lineage` already stops
//! when a parent header is absent, the sync connection-point search converges to
//! a height at or above the floor because lower ones are not "ours", and the RPC
//! answers `null` for a pruned height exactly as it does for an unknown one.
//!
//! Genesis is always retained. It costs one block and keeps every "start of the
//! chain" lookup working, so the gap is a hole in the middle of the chain rather
//! than a missing beginning.
//!
//! # Measured from the executed head, never the header head
//!
//! Both requirements above are about **execution**: it is the executing block
//! that reaches back 4,000, and a reorg that re-executes. So the retention
//! depth is measured from the block this node has executed to, not from the
//! best header it holds.
//!
//! The two are the same on a node that is keeping up and wildly different on
//! one that is not. A snapshot-synced node has every header of the chain but
//! has executed only from its checkpoint, so its header head can sit thousands
//! of blocks above its executed head -- and a sweep measured from the header
//! head deletes blocks that execution has not reached yet but still needs.
//!
//! Observed: a test node pruned to #9,274,241 while executing #9,275,670,
//! whose REMASC payout needed #9,271,670. That block was gone, execution
//! failed, and no retry could succeed because the data was not coming back.
//!
//! The clamp lives here rather than in the callers. Deleting history is not
//! recoverable, so the rule belongs at the point of deletion where no caller
//! can forget it.
//!
//! The floor is recorded in the database -- number, hash and total difficulty --
//! so a node can say what it holds without a scan, and so the value needed to
//! keep total difficulty accumulating is never the thing that was deleted.
