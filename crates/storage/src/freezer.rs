//! Old headers, stored in flat files instead of the LSM tree.
//!
//! # The problem this solves
//!
//! Headers live in `CF_HEADERS`, keyed by block hash. Hashes are uniformly
//! distributed, so consecutive blocks share neither a data block nor usually a
//! file. Serving the 192 headers a peer asks for is therefore 192 unrelated
//! point lookups, and each one pulls a whole RocksDB data block off the disk to
//! return ~1.1 KB of header. Measured on this database: **6.5x read
//! amplification**, ~7.1 KB read per header delivered.
//!
//! The amplification is not a tuning problem. It follows from the key: a hash
//! index cannot answer "the headers from N downwards" as a range, because the
//! keys are not ordered by anything the question mentions.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! Canonical headers below a threshold are append-only and never change, so
//! they can be stored the way the question asks for them: **by block number, in
//! order, contiguously**. A run of headers becomes one index read and one
//! sequential data read.
//!
//! Two file series, following geth's freezer:
//!
//! - `headers-NNNN.cdat` — the RLP bodies, concatenated, capped at
//!   [`MAX_DATA_FILE_BYTES`] so no single file grows without bound.
//! - `headers.cidx` — a fixed-width index, [`INDEX_ENTRY_BYTES`] per block:
//!   a 2-byte file number and the 4-byte `start` and `end` offsets of that
//!   block's data.
//!
//! Entry `N` is at byte `N * 10`, so finding block `N` is arithmetic rather
//! than a search, and the run `N..N+k` is one read of `k * 10` bytes.
//!
//! # Why each entry carries its own start
//!
//! geth stores only the end offset and takes block `N`'s start from block
//! `N-1`'s end. That is two bytes cheaper and it forces the data to be written
//! in ascending order, which this node cannot promise: a snapshot sync walks
//! the header chain **downwards**, from the tip to genesis, verifying
//! `parent_hash` as it goes. Buffering that walk to re-emit it ascending would
//! mean holding every header from the tip to block 0 -- 8.8 million of them,
//! about 9.7 GB -- before the first append became legal.
//!
//! Carrying both offsets makes the format indifferent to arrival order. A
//! descending walk writes its run backwards through the file and a run is
//! still one contiguous read, because what matters is that a single walk's
//! blocks are adjacent, not that they ascend.
//!
//! An entry of all zeroes means "not here". Block 0 cannot collide with that
//! because its `end` is past its `start`, and the index file is sparse: a hole
//! reads as zeroes, so a number never written simply reports absent.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **Nothing is deleted from RocksDB.** geth deletes after fsync, and can,
//! because it keeps a hash-to-number index to redirect lookups by hash. This
//! database has no such index -- `CF_HEIGHT_INDEX` maps number to hashes, the
//! wrong direction -- so deleting `CF_HEADERS` would break every lookup by
//! hash. The duplication costs about 10 GB against a measured read win; closing
//! that gap needs the reverse index first, and is deliberately separate work.
//!
//! **Only canonical headers.** A header that is not canonical at its height has
//! no place in a file addressed by height. Those stay in RocksDB, which is also
//! where a reorg goes looking for them.
