//! The node's position on the chain, read and written as one thing.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The node keeps three facts about where it is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   KEY_HEAD        the highest block we consider downloaded and linked
//!   KEY_EXEC_HEAD   the highest block we have actually executed
//!   CF_NUMBERS      height -> hash, the canonical index
//! ```
//!
//! Every sync stall this node has suffered -- seven of them, costing minutes,
//! hours and days -- has been the same sentence: **two of those three
//! disagreed, and some code path read the one that was wrong.** They were
//! independently writable, so a caller could update one and not the others, and
//! nothing anywhere said they had to agree.
//!
//! The narrow fixes did not converge. The fifth fix caused the sixth: the
//! orphan-adopt path called [`BlockStore::ensure_canonical_lineage`], which
//! writes `CF_NUMBERS` and nothing else, leaving mainnet #9,262,402 held,
//! linked, valid and unreachable for three hours because every path that looks
//! for work reads `KEY_HEAD`.
//!
//! So this module stops treating that as a bug to be found and starts treating
//! it as a state to be made unrepresentable:
//!
//! * [`Cursor`] is the only way to ask where we are. It reads all three.
//! * [`Validated`] is a block reference that **cannot be constructed** without
//!   proving the header is held and its lineage links. It is the only thing
//!   that can advance a head.
//! * [`Transition`] is the only way to change position, and every variant
//!   writes whatever keys must move **together**, in one `WriteBatch`.
//!
//! There is deliberately no way to write a canonical entry without saying what
//! the head becomes. Stall 6 is not defended against here; it is not
//! expressible.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It does not make the node choose the *right* head -- that is fork choice,
//! and it is elsewhere. It guarantees only that whatever the node chooses, its
//! three notions of position agree about it afterwards.
