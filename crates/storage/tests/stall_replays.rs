//! The seven recorded stalls, replayed against the position API.
//!
//! Each test builds the shape the live node was actually found in -- heights
//! and hashes from `docs/sync-redesign.md` Appendix A and from the incident
//! logs -- and asserts one of two things:
//!
//! * the shape **cannot be produced** through the public API any more, or
//! * it is **detected and repaired**, rather than sat in for hours.
//!
//! The distinction matters. A shape that is merely detected is a shape a future
//! caller can still create. A shape that cannot be expressed is closed.
//!
//! | # | Date | Cost | Shape |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | — | — | cursor skipped an unexecuted range |
//! | 2 | — | until restart | hole in the canonical index |
//! | 3 | — | 20 hours | follow-mode gap: downloaded at tip, executed behind |
//! | 4 | — | 3 days | executed head orphaned by a branch we never adopted |
//! | 5 | 2026-09-22 | 15 min | canonical pointer to a block never downloaded |
//! | 6 | 2026-09-22 | 3 hours | canonical entry stranded above the head |
