//! The value store: an append-only sequence of records over memory-mapped
//! segments, addressed by a flat byte offset.
//!
//! Records are never moved, never rewritten and never reclaimed, so an
//! offset handed out once stays valid forever and offsets only increase.
//! Those two properties are what let the index address a record with a bare
//! integer and let the checkpoint express "what is committed" as a single
//! watermark. Space comes back by discarding a whole database, not by
//! collecting inside one.
//!
//! Record layout, unchanged from the Java original so the formats stay
//! comparable:
//!
//! ```text
//! [magic 2B] [length 1B or 4B] [key 32B, optional] [data]
//! ```
//!
//! A one-byte length is a short record and never stores its key. A
//! four-byte length has bit 31 set to mark the long form and bit 30 set
//! when the key precedes the data. The leading magic is what turns a wild
//! offset into a miss instead of arbitrary bytes.
