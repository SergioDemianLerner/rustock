//! Cumulative-difficulty checkpoints, and an upper bound on the work a chain
//! can carry above one.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! A peer advertises a total difficulty and a height. Nothing in the protocol
//! makes that claim cost anything, and a node with no chain of its own has
//! nothing to check it against — so it will follow the claim, download headers
//! for as long as the peer cares to serve them, and only discover the lie at
//! the bottom of the chain, if at all.
//!
//! # Two kinds of checkpoint, and why this is the safe one
//!
//! A **hash** checkpoint asserts identity: *the block at height H is X*. If it
//! is ever wrong — a bad build, a compromised release — the node silently
//! follows a chain nobody else is on, and cannot tell from the inside that
//! anything is amiss.
//!
//! A **cumulative difficulty** checkpoint asserts a bound: *the work from
//! genesis to height H is Y, so nothing may claim more for that height*. If it
//! is wrong, the node can notice: it will find a chain that is valid by every
//! other rule and carries more work than the checkpoint permits. That is a
//! contradiction it can report rather than a capture it cannot see.
//!
//! The failure directions are not symmetric, which is the whole argument:
//!
//! | checkpoint is | hash | cumulative difficulty |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | wrong | silent capture | detectable contradiction |
//! | too generous | no such thing | weak, harmless |
//! | stale | irrelevant or fatal | merely covers less of the chain |
//!
//! So: **err high**. A checkpoint above the true value constrains nothing and
//! harms nothing. One below it is caught by [`CheckpointVerdict::Contradicted`]
//! and is the operator's problem, loudly.
//!
//! # Bounding the window above the checkpoint
//!
//! Below the checkpoint the answer is exact — the work is `Y`. Above it, the
//! chain is bounded by the retarget rule, which changes difficulty by a fixed
//! fraction of the parent's on every block:
//!
//! ```text
//! quotient = parent.difficulty / divisor
//! child    = parent.difficulty ± quotient      (or unchanged)
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing a miner controls changes that magnitude. The timestamp and uncle
//! count pick only the *sign*. So between two headers whose difficulty is known
//! — and whose proof of work has been checked — the work-maximising path is to
//! rise at `(1 + 1/divisor)` for as long as possible and then fall at
//! `(1 - 1/divisor)`, arriving at or below the later header's difficulty.
//!
//! Summing that bound across sampled intervals, and adding `Y`, gives a ceiling
//! on the total difficulty any chain through those samples can carry. A peer
//! claiming more than the ceiling is claiming something no valid chain can
//! provide.
