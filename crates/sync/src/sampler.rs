//! Sampling a peer's chain to bound the work it can be carrying.
//!
//! A peer advertises a total difficulty. Below the shipped checkpoint that
//! claim is answered by arithmetic — the work to that height is known, so
//! nothing may claim more for it. Above the checkpoint there is nothing to
//! check against, and that window is where a lie lives.
//!
//! So sample it. Ask the peer for one header every [`SAMPLE_INTERVAL`] blocks
//! above the checkpoint, verify each one's proof of work, and feed the
//! difficulties to [`rustock_core::checkpoint::ceiling_for`]. The retarget rule
//! bounds how much work the blocks *between* samples can represent, so a
//! ceiling follows for the whole chain — and a peer claiming more than the
//! ceiling is claiming something no valid chain can provide.
//!
//! # What makes this affordable
//!
//! The samples must come from the peer being judged: if its chain is
//! fabricated, nobody else holds those blocks. That puts the cost under rskj's
//! inbound limit of 1,000 messages per minute per peer — so the number of
//! samples, not the bytes, is the budget.
//!
//! With a checkpoint refreshed each release the window is small. Three months
//! of chain at [`SAMPLE_INTERVAL`] is about 340 samples: roughly twenty seconds
//! against that limit, against the ~34 minutes it would take to sample the
//! whole chain.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not say *which* chain a peer is on, only how much work it may claim.
//! A peer serving a valid minority chain within the ceiling passes. It is a
//! filter on who is worth talking to, not a substitute for validating what they
//! then send.
