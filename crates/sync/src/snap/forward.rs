//! Walking the header chain *up* from ground this node already trusts.
//!
//! The counterpart to [`super::headers`], which descends from a checkpoint a
//! peer offered. Both fetch the same descending 192-header chunks -- the wire
//! has no forward request, `BlockHeadersQuery` being `{ hash, count }` with no
//! direction -- and both link those chunks by hash. What differs is which end
//! is trusted, and therefore which way confidence flows.
//!
//! # Why bother, when the other one works
//!
//! A descending walk is one bet on one peer's offer. Nothing it fetches is
//! worth anything until an unbroken run of links reaches ground, so a walk that
//! dies at ninety percent has established nothing, and how far to fan out is a
//! question about how much conditional work one is willing to throw away.
//!
//! Ascending from an anchor, a chunk is permanently valuable the moment it
//! links to the prefix below it. A peer that answers wrongly costs its own
//! chunk and nothing else. That is what makes wide fan-out across many peers
//! cheap to attempt, and it is the whole practical argument for this shape.
//!
//! See `docs/header-first-sync.md` for the design note this implements.
//!
//! # What it establishes
//!
//! The chain's **exact** cumulative difficulty, which in RSK is
//! `trunk.difficulty + sum(uncle.difficulty)` and is therefore not computable
//! from trunk headers alone. This walk takes `BlockHeadersWithUncles`
//! (RSKIP-698) and proves the uncle work rather than assuming or bounding it:
//!
//! 1. `ommers_hash` is inside what the trunk header's proof of work commits to,
//!    so a list matching it cannot have been added to, dropped from or altered.
//!    [`HeaderWithUncles::commitment_matches`] is that check.
//! 2. Each uncle header carries its **own** merged-mining proof of work. A
//!    matching commitment only proves the miner chose this list; verifying each
//!    uncle's proof is what makes its difficulty work rather than a number the
//!    miner wrote down.
//! 3. An uncle hash already counted under another trunk header is refused.
//!    Consensus forbids reuse (`validateIfUncleWasNeverUsed`); without the
//!    check the same uncle's difficulty counts many times over.
//!
//! All three are needed. Any one alone leaves the total an assertion, and no
//! header field substitutes for them -- work is proven by exhibiting it.
