//! Walking the header chain down from the checkpoint, in parallel.
//!
//! # Why the obvious way is slow
//!
//! To ask for headers you need a hash, and the only hash you have is the one
//! the last answer gave you. So the natural walk -- ask for 192 headers, take
//! the oldest one's parent, ask again -- is strictly serial. For a node
//! starting from nothing that is about 48,000 round trips, one at a time,
//! before a single byte of state is requested. rskj's client walks this way.
//!
//! # Breaking the dependency
//!
//! A *skeleton* request answers with block identifiers at fixed heights --
//! twenty of them, 192 apart -- and it is addressed by height, not by hash. So
//! skeletons can all be asked for at once, and each identifier they return is
//! the starting hash for a header request that can also be asked for at once.
//!
//! What that buys is not fewer messages. It is that the messages no longer
//! have to wait for each other.
//!
//! # What it must not cost
//!
//! A skeleton identifier is a peer's claim about which block sits at a height.
//! Believing one would hand a peer the chain. It is never believed: it says
//! only *where to ask*, and what makes the answer trustworthy is that the
//! chunks **link**.
//!
//! Chunk boundaries are arithmetic rather than a search, because a request
//! from the hash at height `p` returns `p` down to `p-191`. So the chunk
//! below `p` starts at `p-192`, and:
//!
//! ```text
//! chunk(p).oldest.parent_hash == chunk(p-192).newest.hash()
//! ```
//!
//! A wrong identifier produces a chunk that fails that test, and the range is
//! asked of somebody else. The chain is trusted exactly when an unbroken run
//! of these links reaches from the checkpoint down to a block already in this
//! node's canonical index -- the same anchor the serial walk used, and for the
//! same reason: the canonical index is the one thing the walk cannot write.
//!
//! Every header is checked under the full consensus rules, merged-mining proof
//! of work included, exactly as before. Pipelining changes when the questions
//! are asked, not which answers are accepted.
