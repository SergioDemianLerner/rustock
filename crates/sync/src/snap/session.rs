//! One snapshot sync, start to finish.
//!
//! The session is a state machine with no I/O and no clock: it is asked what
//! to do next, told what arrived, and says when it is finished. Everything
//! about peers -- choosing them, timing them out, scoring them -- belongs to
//! the caller. That split is deliberate: the part that decides whether to
//! trust a state should be readable in one sitting and testable without a
//! network.
//!
//! # The order of things, and why
//!
//! 1. **Ask for a status.** A peer names a checkpoint block and the 400
//!    blocks before it. None of it is believed yet.
//! 2. **Verify the headers back to something known.** Each header is checked
//!    under the consensus rules, including merged-mining proof of work, and
//!    linked to its child by hash. The walk ends at a block this node already
//!    has -- for a fresh node, genesis. Until this finishes, the checkpoint
//!    is a stranger's claim; after it, forging one costs what it costs to mine
//!    the chain.
//! 3. **Download the state** under that header's `state_root`, every chunk
//!    proved on arrival.
//! 4. **Download the bodies** of the blocks behind the checkpoint, because
//!    contracts can read recent block data and the state alone would not be
//!    enough to execute what comes next.
//!
//! Step 2 before step 3 is the whole trust argument. A client that downloads
//! first and verifies the header chain afterwards has spent an hour on
//! whatever a stranger sent it; one that verifies first spends the hour only
//! on a chain with real work behind it.
