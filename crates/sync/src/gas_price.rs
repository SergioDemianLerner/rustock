//! rskj's `GasPriceTracker`: what a transaction should pay to be mined.
//!
//! # Why the node needs it
//!
//! Two things were degraded without it, and one was simply wrong.
//!
//! **`eth_gasPrice` answered with the head block's `minimumGasPrice`.** That
//! is the floor a transaction must clear to be *valid*, not the price it
//! should pay to be *mined*. A wallet trusting it during congestion underpays
//! and its transaction sits.
//!
//! **The rate limiter's low-gas-price factor was disabled.** Five of
//! `VirtualGasCalculator`'s six factors were computed; the sixth needs a
//! market average and so took rskj's `createSkippingGasPriceFactor` branch,
//! pinning it to 1 instead of the 1..4 it ranges over. A transaction priced at
//! the block minimum therefore cost four times less virtual gas than on an
//! rskj node with a working fee market -- and pricing at the floor is exactly
//! the optimal play for someone flooding by broadcast-then-replace, who does
//! not want their transactions mined at all. It is the factor most directly
//! aimed at the abuse the limiter exists for.
//!
//! # The algorithm, and its quirks
//!
//! Two windows, both rskj's sizes:
//!
//! * **512 transactions** for the price percentile, REMASC excluded (it
//!   carries no gas price and would drag the answer to zero).
//! * **50 blocks** for fullness, used only to decide whether the fee market is
//!   "working" -- average fullness at or above 90%.
//!
//! Three details are rskj's and are not what you would write from scratch:
//!
//! * **The answer is the 25th percentile**, not the median:
//!   `values[values.length / 4]` of the sorted window. A suggestion at the
//!   lower quartile, floored by the block minimum times 1.1.
//! * **It is recalculated only every 512 transactions.** rskj caches the
//!   sorted result in `lastVal` and clears it only when the ring wraps
//!   (`// recalculate only 'sometimes'`), so the answer is stale by up to a
//!   full window. Recomputing on every call would be more accurate and would
//!   not match.
//! * **The transaction ring fills backwards**, from index 511 down to 0, and
//!   "is it primed?" is `txWindow[0] == null`. So the calculator returns
//!   nothing at all until it has seen 512 transactions, however many blocks
//!   that took.
//!
//! On a chain with spare capacity rskj itself runs with the low-gas-price
//! factor skipped much of the time, because `isFeeMarketWorking()` is false
//! whenever the 50-block window is not full or average fullness is under 90%.
//! That is a real rskj path, not a degraded one. The difference is that rskj
//! *recovers* the factor when blocks fill up.
