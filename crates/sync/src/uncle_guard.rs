//! Putting uncles through the full consensus rule on a node that has no bodies.
//!
//! `HeaderWithUncles` (RSKIP-698) hands a header-only client the uncle headers
//! a block references, and their difficulties count toward the chain's work.
//! Crediting that work means deciding the uncles are admissible, and
//! `rustock_core::validation::uncles` already says what admissible means --
//! rskj's `BlockUnclesValidationRule`, every rule of it.
//!
//! That rule needs two things from a store: the header behind a hash, and the
//! **uncles of a stored block**. A node syncing headers has the first and not
//! the second: uncle headers live in bodies, and it has no bodies. So it would
//! be stuck checking a fraction of the rules -- which is how a miner gets work
//! credited that it never did.
//!
//! [`UncleGuard`] supplies the missing half from what the wire already
//! delivered. Every `HeaderWithUncles` that passes carries its block's uncle
//! list, so the client keeps those lists for as long as the rule can still
//! refer to them, and answers `uncles_of` from that.
//!
//! # Why a window is enough
//!
//! Consensus lets a block reference an uncle only within
//! [`UNCLE_GENERATION_LIMIT`] generations of it, and `used_uncles` walks no
//! further back than that from the block being judged. Nothing older can
//! affect the verdict, so nothing older is kept. The ledger is bounded by the
//! rule it serves rather than by the length of the chain.
//!
//! # What happens when it cannot decide
//!
//! It refuses. If an ancestor's header or uncle list is missing -- a skeleton
//! chunk that has not landed, a restart that emptied the window -- the rule
//! would run against an incomplete ancestry and could miss a reuse. So the
//! caller credits no uncle difficulty for that block. The total is then a
//! lower bound, which refuses a peer claiming too much rather than admitting
//! one.
