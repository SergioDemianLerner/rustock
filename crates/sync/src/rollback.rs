//! Where execution must resume when the executed head becomes unusable.
//!
//! # The decision, and why it is its own module
//!
//! Three separate bugs in one day (2026-09-23) lived in this decision, each
//! introduced while fixing the previous one:
//!
//! | # | The rule that was broken |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | targeted the orphaned head's own parent, which is on the branch being abandoned and so is not canonical either -- the write was refused and the caller gave up |
//! | 2 | nothing responded to a missing state root at all, so the node retried the same impossible block forever |
//! | 3 | searched by **height** rather than by **ancestry**, so it could re-record execution sideways onto a sibling the node had never executed |
//!
//! Bug 3 is the subtle one and it is worth stating plainly. The executed head
//! is a claim: *"I have executed up to this block, and the resulting state is
//! this root."* A sibling at the same height is a different block with a
//! different state. Its root may well be present in the trie -- state roots
//! are shared and forks get executed too -- but recording it makes the claim
//! **false**, and the next block then executes against a state that does not
//! match. On mainnet that surfaced as
//! `NonceTooLow { tx: 177, state: 178 }`: the state was one transaction ahead
//! of where the marker said it was.
//!
//! So the rule, in one sentence:
//!
//! > **Execution may only resume at a block on the executed head's own
//! > ancestry that is also canonical and whose state we still hold.**
//!
//! Ancestry, because those are the only blocks this node has actually
//! executed. Canonical, because [`rustock_storage::Transition::Executed`]
//! refuses anything else -- correctly. State present, because otherwise the
//! node cannot continue and would only discover it on the next block.
//!
//! # Why it is pure
//!
//! The decision takes a [`ChainView`] rather than a store, so it can be driven
//! by a simulator over thousands of generated chains, forks and patterns of
//! missing state. That is a small instance of what stage 6 of
//! `docs/sync-redesign.md` proposes for the whole sync loop, and it exists
//! because all three bugs above were in recovery paths the position-layer
//! simulator structurally could not reach.
