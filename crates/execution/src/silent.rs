//! Bridge decisions that reach consensus but emit no event.
//!
//! The Bridge logs a lot, but not everything, and what it does log has grown
//! over time behind activations. A question like "has a peg-in ever been
//! refunded" is answered in seconds where an event exists and needs a full
//! historical replay where one does not -- mainnet's only two refunds predate
//! `rejected_pegin` by 760,000 blocks, so the event-based answer is "none".
//!
//! This module lets a replay record those decisions as they are made, so the
//! replay is paid for once. Records are **derived, not consensus**: nothing
//! here is read back during execution, and deleting them loses no state.
//!
//! The sink is off unless a tool turns it on, so ordinary block processing
//! pays one thread-local boolean check per decision point.
