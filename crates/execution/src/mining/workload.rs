//! Generating block workloads with a known collision structure.
//!
//! Built to answer one question about the RSKIP-144 miner: given
//! transactions whose dependencies we chose on purpose, does it partition
//! them the way we expect, and does the block it produces validate?
//!
//! The transfers run through a token contract rather than moving rBTC,
//! because a token transfer's collisions are **storage** collisions and
//! those are the ones we can place freely. A native transfer touches the two
//! account cells and nothing else; a token transfer touches two cells of our
//! choosing, so the transfer graph *is* the collision graph and we can draw
//! it.
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic from a seed. That is not tidiness: the
//! point of the exercise is to hand the same transactions to another
//! implementation and compare the partitions, and transactions regenerated
//! rather than replayed would make a difference in the input
//! indistinguishable from a difference in the decision.
