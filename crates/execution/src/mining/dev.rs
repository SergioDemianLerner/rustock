//! Mining and clock control for a development chain.
//!
//! Everything here exists to serve rskj's `evm_*` RPC namespace, which is how
//! contract test suites drive a node: mine on demand, jump the clock, snapshot
//! and roll back. None of it belongs on a node facing a real network, and the
//! RPC layer gates the whole namespace behind an explicit flag.
//!
//! # The clock
//!
//! `evm_increaseTime` moves the timestamp the *next* block will carry, and
//! every block after it, without moving the system clock. rskj keeps the same
//! offset in `MinerClock`. It is a process-wide offset here because the block
//! template is built in several places and threading a clock through all of
//! them to serve a development-only feature would be worse than one atomic.
//!
//! # Local mining
//!
//! An RSK block needs merged-mining proof of work, so "mine a block" means
//! building a Bitcoin block that commits to the RSK work hash and brute-forcing
//! its nonce until it clears the target. That is what rskj's `MinerClientImpl`
//! does, and on a development chain the target is easy enough that it lands in
//! a handful of attempts.
//!
//! On a real network's difficulty it would not, which is the honest reason
//! this cannot be misused: the loop is bounded and gives up.
