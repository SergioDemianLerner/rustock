//! Remembering which key signed which transaction.
//!
//! A transaction's sender is recovered from its signature, and the same
//! transaction has its sender recovered several times over its life: once when
//! the pool admits it, again when the block carrying it executes, again on
//! every RPC render, and again on each re-execution after a reorg. The
//! recovery is identical every time and it is the most expensive arithmetic
//! the node does per transaction.
//!
//! ## Keyed by the transaction hash, and why that is safe here
//!
//! The key is `Transaction::tx_hash()`. A cache keyed by a hash is only sound
//! if the hash separates every pair of transactions that could recover to
//! different senders — so in particular it must separate two transactions that
//! differ **only** in their `v` byte, since `v` selects both the signing hash
//! (legacy or EIP-155) and the recovery id. Two wire forms that hashed alike
//! but recovered differently would let the first one seen decide the sender of
//! the second.
//!
//! That separation holds, for two independent reasons, and
//! `the_hash_separates_transactions_that_differ_only_in_v` in
//! `rustock_core::types::transaction` pins it:
//!
//! - `v` is stored verbatim as a `u64` and re-encoded verbatim by
//!   `#[derive(RlpEncodable)]`. Nothing reconstructs it from a chain id, so
//!   the encode/decode round trip cannot fold two values onto one.
//! - `tx_hash()` goes through `rlp_for_trie()`, which prefers `cached_rlp` —
//!   the bytes as the peer sent them — and `Decodable::decode` always records
//!   those. Two different wire forms therefore hash differently whatever the
//!   fields decode to.
//!
//! Anything that changes either of those invalidates this cache, which is why
//! both are stated here rather than left to be rediscovered.
//!
//! ## Two tiers, because the two origins are not alike
//!
//! Senders arrive from two places, and they want opposite retention
//! policies. rskj keeps two caches for this and the reason is worth stating,
//! because it is not obvious from the sizes alone:
//!
//! | origin | lifetime | pressure |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | our pool, at admission | long -- a transaction can wait many blocks to be mined | steady, bounded by the pool |
//! | a block from a peer | short -- the block is validated once | bursty, unbounded, attacker-chosen |
//!
//! A single map serving both lets the second evict the first. A peer that
//! streams blocks full of transactions we have never seen would walk the
//! whole cache every few blocks, and the pool-to-execution hop -- the one the
//! cache exists for -- would miss every time. The cache would still *work*,
//! and would simply stop paying, silently.
//!
//! So block-origin entries go in their own small tier and cannot evict
//! pool-origin ones. Lookups read both, so a transaction the pool recovered
//! is still found when its block executes; only writes are segregated. That
//! is exactly what rskj's `BlockTxSignatureCache` does by wrapping
//! `ReceivedTxSignatureCache` and never writing through to it.
//!
//! ## The locking shape
//!
//! The obvious implementation — consult a `Mutex<HashMap>` once per
//! transaction — would serialise the one region `recover_senders` exists to
//! parallelise, and would do it invisibly: the work still happens, just one
//! thread at a time, with no error and nothing in the logs.
//!
//! So the lock is never taken from a worker. A block is looked up **once**,
//! before the threads start; the misses are recovered in parallel with no
//! cache access at all; and the results are written back **once**, after the
//! threads have joined. Two lock acquisitions per block, not one per
//! transaction.
