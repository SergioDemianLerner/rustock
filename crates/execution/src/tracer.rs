//! A VM tracer shaped like rskj's, for `debug_traceTransaction`.
//!
//! # Why this is not go-ethereum's tracer
//!
//! geth returns `{gas, failed, returnValue, structLogs}`. rskj returns its
//! `DetailedProgramTrace`: `contractAddress`, `initStorage`, `structLogs`,
//! `result`, `error`, `reverted`, `storageSize`, `currentStorage`. Consumers
//! of an RSK node are written against the second, so that is what is built
//! here. `docs/debug-namespace.md` has the full comparison.
//!
//! Three details inside `structLogs` are rskj's and easy to get wrong:
//!
//! * **`gas` is measured before the opcode runs, `gasCost` after.** rskj calls
//!   `addOp` with the remaining gas, then `saveGasCost` sets the cost on the
//!   entry it just added. Reporting the post-execution gas instead shifts
//!   every row by one opcode.
//! * **Stack and memory are bare hex, not `0x`-prefixed**, and the stack is
//!   listed **bottom first** -- `stack[0]` is the deepest item, not the top.
//!   Memory is split into 32-byte chunks, the last one short if the memory
//!   size is not a multiple of 32.
//! * **`storage` lags by one opcode, on purpose.** rskj notes the key when it
//!   sees SSTORE or SLOAD (`storageKey = stack.peek()`) and reads its value on
//!   the *next* `addOp`, once the opcode has run. So a step's `storage` shows
//!   the effect of the step before it, and the map accumulates every key
//!   touched so far rather than describing the contract's whole storage.
//!
//! # It must not change what executes
//!
//! A tracer that alters execution is a consensus hazard, not a debugging tool.
//! Two things protect that here: the traced path is separate from block
//! processing -- nothing in `BlockProcessor` consults it -- and the storage
//! read below uses `sload_skip_cold_load`, which does not mark the slot warm.
//!
//! **That second one is defensive rather than load-bearing, and the
//! distinction is worth stating.** On Ethereum a tracer calling plain `sload`
//! would warm the slot and change EIP-2929 gas for every access after it. RSK
//! has no EIP-2929 -- `make_cfg_env` zeroes `cold_storage_cost`,
//! `warm_storage_read_cost` and the rest, which
//! `test_cfg_env_no_eip2929_cold_access_cost` pins -- so on this chain that
//! particular mistake would cost nothing. The skip is used anyway because
//! "this side effect happens to be free here" is an assumption a future RSKIP
//! could quietly invalidate, and not depending on it is free.
//!
//! It follows that `tracing_does_not_change_execution` does **not** prove the
//! tracer is side-effect free; nothing in gas could reveal a warmth change on
//! RSK. What it proves is that the traced and untraced paths agree on gas,
//! output, success and logs -- which is what catches the two setups drifting
//! apart, the likelier failure.
