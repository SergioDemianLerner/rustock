//! Read and write key sets per parallel sublist, and the collision rule
//! RSKIP-144 makes a condition of a block's validity.
//!
//! From RSKIP-144, where sublists execute in parallel:
//!
//! > When all parallel sublists have finished processing, the `readMap`s and
//! > `writeMap`s are scanned to find connections between transactions of
//! > different threads.
//! > - If a key belongs to a `writeMap` and a `readMap` of another parallel
//! >   sublist, then the block is considered invalid.
//! > - If a key belongs to a `writeMap` and a `writeMap` of another parallel
//! >   sublist, then the block is also invalid.
//!
//! This is a rule a validator applies, not a property it may assume the
//! miner established. The distinction matters because the obvious shortcut
//! is wrong: executing the sublists sequentially does *not* stand in for the
//! check. Where sublists conflict, sequential and parallel execution agree
//! in some interleavings and differ in others, so a sequential executor that
//! skips this accepts blocks rskj rejects -- and does so silently, having
//! computed a state root nobody else would reach.
//!
//! Read against read is not a collision. Two sublists may read the same key
//! freely; only a write makes an ordering observable.

///
/// A write that the transaction reverted **cannot** make parallel execution

/// runs after every sublist finishes and *before* any of them is merged, and
/// only then are the tracks committed in sublist order. No sublist ever
/// observes another's uncommitted work, and a reverted write is not in its
/// own sublist's commit either. Every other sublist therefore reads the same
/// value in both execution modes.
///
/// So `Attempted` rejects valid blocks. It is not a simplification RSKIP-144
/// chose -- the document does not mention reverts at all. rskj's tracker
/// lives in `MutableRepository`, `startTracking()` hands the *same* tracker
/// to every nested repository, and a rollback discards only the state cache.
/// The behaviour is where the tracker happened to be placed, and it became
/// consensus.
///
/// ## Why we match it anyway
///
/// Being right is not the same as being compatible. Until the rule changes
/// for everyone at a fork, a node applying `NetChanges` forks itself off the
/// chain. The proposal to change it is
/// `/home/paseo/doc/RSKIP-sublist-net-writes.md`; this mode is kept working
